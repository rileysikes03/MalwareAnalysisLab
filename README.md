# Malware Analysis Environment Setup with Remnux and Flare VM

## Objective
In this project, I explore setting up environments for malware analysis using Remnux and Flare VM. These pre-built toolkits streamline the setup process, enabling quick deployment for effective malware analysis.

## Tools Introduced
- **Remnux**: Toolkit for reverse engineering and analyzing malicious software, featuring a curated collection of community-created tools.
- **Flare VM**: Script collection by Mandiant for automating the setup of a Windows VM optimized for malware analysis.

## Installing Remnux
To install Remnux, you can:
- Download and import the Remnux virtual machine (OVA file).
- Start the VM in VirtualBox after importing, with no login credentials required.

## Installing Flare VM
To install Flare VM on Windows:
- Ensure your environment meets requirements (e.g., Windows 10+, sufficient disk space, RAM).
- Pause Windows updates temporarily.
- Disable Windows Defender and tamper protection via Windows Security settings.

### Steps for Flare VM Installation
1. Open PowerShell as administrator.
2. Download the installation script using `Invoke-WebRequest`.
3. Unblock the downloaded script using `Unblock-File`.
4. Set script execution policy to `Unrestricted`.
5. Run the installation script, confirming any prompts.
6. Configure tool installations (select desired tools).
7. Restart your machine as necessary during installation.

## Setting Up Networking and Snapshots
- Configure your VM's networking mode to 'Host-only' or 'Internal Network' for isolated testing.
- Take a snapshot post-installation for quick resets during subsequent malware analyses.

## Conclusion
Having Remnux and Flare VM ready ensures efficient malware analysis setups. Remnux offers Linux-based static analysis capabilities, while Flare VM provides a Windows environment for dynamic analysis. These tools collectively enhance your capability to investigate and respond to malware effectively.
